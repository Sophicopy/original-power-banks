    <p>
<b>No.1 Scenario</b>
You just got yourself a new power bank and of course you want to start charging.   	

<b>So what do you do?</b>

You connect your phone into the power bank and start browsing the internet.
</p>	
<h2 class="red">WARNING!!</h2>
<h1 class="green">Do You Know What Great Harm You're Doing To Your Power Bank?</h1>
<p>
By using your phone while it's been charged with the power bank, you are reducing the working capacity of your power bank.

In other words, you can reduce the lifespan of your power bank just by using your device during charging. 	

<b>No.2 Scenario</b>
You just came back home from work and you are so tired.
You wanna watch some movie so you start your generator and put on the television.

Then you remember that you left your power bank on the chair and you are wondering whether you should charge it or not.

You decide not to since it still has some battery that you can use for later. 
</p>
 <h2 class="red">WARNING!!</h2>
<h1 class="green">You Are Slowly Destroying Your Power Bank</h1>
<p>
You should always charge your power bank when it's not yet fully charged.
This helps to maintain the battery capacity of your power bank.	

<b>In other words...</b>
In the future, your power bank might not work as well as before if you don't take care to do this.
